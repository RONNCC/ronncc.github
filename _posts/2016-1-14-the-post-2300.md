#Designing Human Centered Systems

## Lecture 1
### Class Questions:
- What is HCI?
- What is UX?
- Why do we care?
### Class Challenges:
- Make $$\geq$$ 5 progress bars and try to see if your participants can guess what % full they are

### Notes
- Everything has a design criteria and is done within a context
- HCI:
    - Human: End user/Other people in org/Surrounding Culture Context
    - Computer: Hardware/Software
    - Interaction: User tells computer what it wants, Computer communicates results
- 3 Legged Stool Analogy (Components of HCI): Computer Science, Design, Behavioral Sciences
- Myths!
    1. Good Design is just cool graphics
    2. Good Design is just common sense
    3. We can fix the interface at the end (USPS card reader example, and adult swim video about guy trying to use auto mail thing).
    4. Marketing takes care of understanding customer needs

(There are 5 more we don't talk about)

#### Why is Good Design Important?
- 50% of work developing
- Bad user interfaces cause loss of money, reputation, time, security, lives! 
- **UX IS KING**
    - hardware isn't a differentiating factor anymore
- How do we make good interfaces?
    - Iterative Design (waterfall is eww)
    - Great ideas are often simple: Mouse, Guis, Touchscreens, Emoticons, Hyperlinks,
    - Good ideas stick around: Wheel & Axle, String/Rope/Shoes, Beds, Doors
    - Physical & Human factors change slowly!
    - Culture and tech change alot!
