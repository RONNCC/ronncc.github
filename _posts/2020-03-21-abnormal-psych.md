- Cognitive-Behavioral Perspective:
	- The cognitive-behavioral perspective proposes that psychologists can best understand abnormal functioning by looking at thinking (cognitive) processes and the associated maladaptive actions that people do (behaviors). The cognitive-behavioral perspective holds that abnormal functioning and behaviors result from the person’s maladaptive, irrational, and inaccurate thoughts about and interpretation of a situation. Cognitive-behavioral theorists and therapists believe that by substituting more realistic, rational thoughts for these irrational ones—and by encouraging more adaptive behaviors—clients can change their outlook on life and thus improve their symptoms.
- Biological Perspective:
	- The biological Perspective adopts a medical, disease perspective on psychological disorders. According to the biological perspective, disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are brought about by malfunctioning parts of the organism. Typically, the biological perspective focuses on genetic predispositions for disorders and abnormalities in brain anatomy or chemistry. The biological perspective argues that in order to treat psychological disorders, abnormalities in the brain must be addressed through medication or other treatments that act on brain chemistry or circuits.
- Psychodynamic Perspective:
	- The psychodynamic perspective argues that abnormality is largely determined by early childhood experiences navigating stages of development focused around erogenous zones: oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital. In particular, psychodynamic theorists argue that if children do not navigate these stages properly due to a poor relationship with the primary parental figures in the child’s life, they will experience abnormality as an adult. Psychodynamic therapists would focus on uncovering repressed memories of negative experiences or uncovering repressed feelings.
- Humanistic Perspective:
	- The humanistic perspective believes in the inherent worth of every individual and that all people have the capacity to strive towards bettering themselves. Those who endorse the humanistic perspective argue that psychological disorders occur when people encounter “conditions of worth” in their lives—unrealistic expectations that others create as conditions that must be met in order to gain love and respect. To counteract this problem, humanist or client-centered theorists and therapists focus on creating a supportive, genuine environment in which the therapist offers unconditional positive regard—that is, support no matter what the client does.
