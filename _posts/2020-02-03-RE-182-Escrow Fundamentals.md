**reading**:
- spanish established forts called presidios to provide protection for settlers
- and pueblos to provide food and other supplies
- Under the Treaty of Guada lupe Hid algo, title to properties was establi shed as
follows:
	- Mexican Land:  Grants Ranchos and public grants delivered by Spain and Mexico were confirmed to be valid.
	- State Lands: State lands were granted by the U.S . Congress to the State of
California
	- federal submerged lands act (1953) granted ownership of tidelands and submerged lands/resources to coastal states like CA
- legal description of land: how recorded in title records/deeds (e.g. lot+tract, metes+bounds, section+township) (things not legal description: street address + asessor's parcel #)
- land descriptions dependent on land surveying and subdividing of properties based on Public land survey system (PLSS) - makes rectangles.	
	- townships are 6x6 miles, each square a "section".
	- when you're making your squares there are monuments to delimit the square. lines that define the center of the square N->S is meridian and the line E->W is the base line.
    - california has humboldt base line (and meridian), mt diablo base line  (and meridian), san barnardino base line  (and meridian). 
- metes + bounds descriptions determine boundaries of the land
- property:
	- real (immovable)
    	- land + stuff affixed to the land like walls/fences/buildings
        - land includes the air but sometimes not like the oil underneath it
    - personal (movable)
    	- fixtures are personal (like a tree) but then you plant it (so it becomes real)
    - transfer deed = title of the land
    - vesting = the manner in which title is held, e.g. "John J. Jones and Mary K. Jones, Husband and Wife as Community Property with Right of Survivorship".


**Ownership kinds:**
  - absolute ownership: one's complete control over property with right to use or dispose of it as holder sees fit
  - qualified ownership (land owned with another is qualified if land use is restricted). Qualified ownership, when owned with others, allows title to be held in several ways:
  	- Joint tenants: "property is owned by two or more persons with equal right s, and that upon the death of one joint tenant, the decea sed's share passes to the other survivor(s). Joint tenant s do not need to be married to each another, or domestic partners with each another. Joint tenant s cannot sell or transfer th eir interest without the consent of the others"
    - Tenants in common: "owned by several persons having equal or common right s, but each owner hold s a separate individual intere st. Unlike joint tenancy, these separate int erests may be sold, transferred, and willed freely without the consent of the others. Additionally, th ey may be encumbered as collateral for finan cing. Pragmatically speaking, however, it would be difficult to find an institutional lender willing to loan to one tenant in common without requiring all owners to be equally liable for repayment."
    - Partnership interest (tenants in partnership): "interest in a property by an association or entity consisting of two or more persons. It is assumed to be an associat ion formed for the purpose of runnin g a forprofit organizat ion."
    - Community Property: "Community property may held either with or without the right of survivor ship , as in the vesting example described earlie r. However, unlik e joint tenants, it is restrict ed to either a married couple or domestic partners. Note th at in California dom estic partners need not be of the same sex. If title is held as community property without specifying the right of survivor sh ip, the co-owners are allowed to separately place their half in a will and may provide for the property to go to someone other than the surviving spouse. If, however, vest ing includes "communit y property with the right of survivorship" upon the death of a spouse, the property would pass to the survivor just as it does in joint tenancy. Certai n tax benefits may be available to a surviving spouse who has taken title as community property and which may not be ava ilable under joint tenancy"
    - Trust: "Property may be held in a trust by a trustee for the benefit of the actual owners who are called beneficiaries. It is important for the escrow officer to understand that the trust cannot take title itself, but rather the trustee receives title on behalf of the trust. An example of vesting would be "John Jones as Trustee of the Jon es Family Trust."
    - As an escrow officer: **Do Not Offer Advice on Vesting!**, refer to legal 

**Estates**
- estate within the context of this section refers to the degree or
extent of one's interest in land. Estates in real property can be either freehold or
less-than-freehold.
	- freehold (originated @ medieval England): an interest in real property that is of an
unspecified period
		- kind 1: fee simple: highest form of ownership
        	- inheritable by will / intestate succession
            - transferable
            - perpetual + unlimited holding term
            - kinds:
            	- fee simple absolute estate - generally no restrictions placed on it, (except govt).  Most common form of interest in real property the escrow and title professional may encounter		- fee simple defeasible: "Specific conditions or restrictions are placed on the transferability of the property. It provides for the conveyance of title back to the transferor if the titl eholder violates the terms of the agreement. However, under California's Marketable Record Title Act of 1982, court action is necessary for the original transferor to seek the return of t itle. -- pretty rare."
            
        - kind 2: life estates
        	- "estate in which ownership exists only during the term of the life of a named person. The person whose life dete rmines the ho lding term may be eith er the person who possesses the life esta te (called a life tenant) or some other named individual." - when the person dies it goes back to the giver
            - Estate in reversion: when person named under a life estate dies. In this case, t itle reverts to the grantor. Reversion is not limit ed to only life estates. For example, it may apply to a transfer of title that provides that if a certain act specified in the transfer agreement is perfo rmed by the grantee, title automat ically reverts to the grantor.
            - Estate in Remainder: life estate may be created for the life of the titleholder, with the right to occupy and enjoy the property during the t itleholde r's life. Upon the death of the titleholder, the estate transfers to the named heir as an estate in remainder.
	- less than freehold
    	- leased interest in property
        	- estate for years: lease with a termination date
            - period to period: month-month rental
            - at will: no specifed term/rental agreement. landowner can kick ya out whenever
            - at sufferance: if you dont have a lease or permission to be there but you're there - frequently escrow transaction has a contingency clause to address this
