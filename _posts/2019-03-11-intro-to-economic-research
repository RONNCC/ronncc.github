## Replication Exercise (GSI Stephanie Bonds)
### Intro
- We're learning how to do regressions
- Replicate: The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development 
- Fact: Differences in income/paita and other measures of economic performance across countries
- Research Q: Effect of institions on economic performance? Hypothe: Better instititions achieve higher levels of income/capita

### Premises
- Diffrerent colonization policies had diff effects on the development of institioutions
	- Extractive states (eg Belgian Congo) transferred resources colony -> host
    - Neo Europes: replicate European institions /w property rights
- Feasibility of particular seattlementinfluenced colonization strategy (eg more disease prevalence more likely to become "extractive state"
- Large body of literature that settler mortality rates were key determinant of European settlement. (eg Pilgrims -> US instead Guyana b/c more mortality in latter)
- Sources of mortality (eg yellow fever and malaria)  differentiatly affected European settlers
	- Natives had higher resistance
- Theory (potential): setler mortality -> settlements -> early institutions -> current institions -> current performance

## Data
- Current econ performanc/capita = 1995
- Current/past instititional quality
