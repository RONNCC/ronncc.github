# Chapter 1
-  word “personality” originated from the Latin persona
- **personality**: a pattern of relatively permanent traits and unique characteristics that give both consistency and individuality to a person’s behavior
- **Traits**: contribute to individual differences in behavior, consistency of behavior over time, and stability of behavior across situations
- **Characteristics**: unique qualities of an individual that include such attributes as temperament, physique, and intelligence
- **taxonomy** : a classification of things according to their natural relationships

Theoretical Perspectives on Personality:
- Psychodynamic Theories
	- importance of early childhood experience and on relationships with parents as guiding forces that shape personality development
    -  traditionally used dream inter- pretation to uncover the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and impulses as a main form of treatment of neurosis and mental illness.
    - After Freud, these theorists moved away from the importance of sexuality and more toward social and cultural forces.
- Humanistic-Existential Theories
	- people strive toward meaning, growth, well-being, happi- ness, and psychological health
    - Existential theorists assume that not only are we driven by a search for meaning, but also that negative experiences such as failure, awareness of death, death of a loved one, and anxiety, are part of the human condition and can foster psychological growth
- Dispositional Theories
	- unique and long-term tendencies to behave in particular ways are the essence of our personality
    - five main trait dimensions in human personality
- Biological-Evolutionary Theories
	- Behavior, thought, feelings, and personality are influenced by differences in basic genetic, epigenetic, and neurological systems between individuals. 
- Learning-(Social) Cognitive Theories
	- All behaviors are learned through association and/or its consequences (whether it is reinforced or punished). To shape desired behavior we have to understand and then establish the conditions that bring about those particular behaviors.

**psychology of science** :look at personal traits of scientists. The psychology of science studies both science and the behavior of scientists; 

**Dimensions for a Concept of Humanity:**
Personality theories differ on basic issues concerning the nature of humanity

1. determinism versus free choice
2. pessimism versus optimism
3. causality versus teleology
	- causality holds that behavior is a function of past experiences, whereas teleology is an explanation of behavior in terms of future goals or purposes
4. conscious versus unconscious determinants of behavior
5. biological versus social influences on per- sonality
6. uniqueness versus similarities

**reliability**: of a measuring instrument is the extent to which it yields consistent results.

**Validity** : the degree to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure.
- Personality psychologists are  concerned with two types of validity:
	1. construct validity
    	- Construct validity is the extent to which an instrument measures some hypothetical construct
        - Constructs such as extraversion, aggressiveness, intelligence, and emotional stability have no physi- cal existence; they are hypothetical constructs that should relate to observable behavior.
        - Three important types of construct validity:
        	- convergent validity
            	- A measuring instrument has convergent construct validity to the extent that scores on that instrument correlate highly (converge) with scores on a variety of valid measures of that same construct
            - divergent validity
            	- An inventory has divergent construct validity if it has low or insignificant correlations with other inventories that do not measure that construct
                - For example, an inventory purporting to measure extraversion should not be highly correlated with social desirability, emotional stability, honesty, or self-esteem. 
            - discriminant validity
            	- an inventory has discriminant validity if it discriminates between two groups of people known to be different. 
                - For example, a personality inventory measuring extraversion should yield higher scores for people known to be extraverted than for people known to be introverted
    2. predictive validity
    	- extent that a test predicts some future behavior
