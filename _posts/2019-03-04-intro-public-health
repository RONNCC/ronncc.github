# 7 Health status by Age -- of adolescents, young adults, and adults

## Define

- risk factor: rait, behavior or condition associated with a higher probability of disease or injury
- protective factor: trait, behavior or condition associated with a lower probability of disease or injury/ faster recovery rate
- Adolescence: generally described as puberty to maturity


## Goals

- Explain why it is important for community health workers to be aware of the different health concerns of the various age groups in the United States.

 Many health beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are adopted and consolidated during adolescence.

- Define by age the groups of adolescents, young adults, and adults.

Adolescents and young adults - ages 10-24 years
Adults - ages 25-64 years
Ages 15-64 considered most productive years

- Briefly describe key demographic characteristics of adolescents and young adults

	- (2010) 10-24 yr ~ 25% US Pop
	- Increasingly diverse: (2012) 55% non-hispanic white -> 44% (2050)
    - < 18 single parent home ⬆️

- Explain what the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) are and what type of data they generate.

- Provide a brief behavioral risk profile for adolescents, young adults (including those attending college), and adults.

	- High Schoolers:
    	- unintentional injuries: seat belt/bicycle helmet/motorcycle helmet use, Drinking+Driving/riding with drunk driver
        - violence: weapons, dating violence, physical fights, forced sexual activity, bullying, suicide ideation/attempts
        - tobacco: Widespread @ highschoolers: majority dependent before 18. smokeless tobacco
        - alcohol: experimentation @ [15-24]
        - drugs: 20% @ marijuana, 20% unprescribed drugs; others (cocaine...)  
        - sex: Unintended Pregnancy + STD ~50% hs'ers; Improving rates @ contraceptives
        - Physical activity/sedentary: lack concerning. Males more likely > females; Screen time risk factor; physical activity linked to positive outcomes
        - Overweight: ⬆️ concern for age group. Risk factor @ chronic disease. rise in rate (steady @ 2011-; 17% overweight/obese). Dieting through unhealthy means + eating disorders.
        
    - College students:
    	- unintentional injuries, violence, tobacco, alcohol/drugs, unint. pregnancies/STDs
        - vs peers: ⬆️ alcohol abuse, ⬇️violence
        - protective factors e.g. school connectedness, community service
        - main issue: alcohol.
        
    - Adults:
    	-  25 to 64: leading cause cancer:
        	- men: prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer
            - women: breast, lung, and colorectal cancer
            - 85% lung cancer ~ smoking
        - Also Cardiovascular diseases leading cause of death
            

- Outline the health profiles for the various age groups, listing the major causes of mortality, morbidity, and risk factors for each group (for example, list the 3 leading causes of death, the most common causes of illness or injury, and at least 4 leading risk factors for each group).

	- Most health threats are behavior not disease
    - 3/4 mortality: injuries (motor vehicle crashes, homicide, suicide); Health disparities by race/gender/social class 
    - Adolescents/Young Adults highest risk @ STDs (~50%)
    

- Give examples of community health strategies for improving the health status of adolescents, young adults, and adults, including the use of health screenings and health promotion.

    - College students @ Alcohol:
      - Change the social norms about alcohol
      - Community-wide measures
      - Sustained over time
      - Foster institutional changes
      - Involve youth and young adults in finding and creating solutions to problematic alcohol use

	- Secondary Prevention: Screening high risk populations. eg hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol
    
    - Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs
		a. Exercise and nutrition programs (primary prevention)
		b. Self or clinical screenings (secondary prevention)
		c. Medication compliance (tertiary prevention)

 

- Discuss tobacco control and prevention, including examples of strategies used to reduce tobacco use, as a means of improving adult health. While the diseases associated with tobacco usually start in adulthood, tobacco use usually starts in adolescence, so many prevention strategies address adolescents and young adults, to preserve adult health.

	- Widespread @ highschoolers: majority dependent before 18. smokeless tobacco.

- Discuss e-cigarette usage and vaping of nicotine products as an emerging public health epidemic



# 5 Community Organizing

"Communities are not only ["where health happens"](http://www.calendow.org/building-healthy-communities/). It is also often the place where residents take action to alter the conditions that affect their health"

## Define

- community organizing: "process by which community members come together to address a shared problem or opportunity, ... to attain a change in their shared environment. ... often involves working on a policy change at the local level..."
- community organizing: "defined as the process by which community groups are helped to identify common problems or goals, mobilize resources, and develop and implement strategies for reaching the goals they collectively have set"
- community capacity:
- community participation:
- community building:
- empowered community:



## Strategies for community organization
- planning and policy practice:
- community capacity development:
- social advocacy:

needs-based vs strengths-based community organizing models:

## Generalized model for community organizing/building steps

## Common tools or tactics for community organizing

## Case study of community organizing for health

## Role of community health workers in community organizing for health 
e.g. their role in informing, involving, collaborating and empowering community residents

empowerment: process by which individuals or communities take control over their lives and environment

(re empowerment): Either greater community problem-solving ability / change in conditions/relations of power. Community not strictly defined. 
Community organizing processes: 
- Confrontational: Social Justice Advocacy/Alinksky Style (Saul Alinsky: Rules for Radicals)
- Consensus: Build in communities capacity to resolve challenges
- Using data + working /w Local Gov for new policies: (consensus also)
- In common: Recognizing the value of prevention and equity

Environmental Justice: seeks to ensure that the costs of our industrial society (noise, air pollution, water pollution, etc.) do not unfairly fall in a disproportionate way on communities of color and more generally, poor and working class communities  (Principles of env justice: http://www.ejnet.org/ej/principles.html)

Environmental Health: sub-discipline within Public Health that examines the biological, physical and chemical factors in our environment that affect health.

The community action model is an interactive five-step process designed to address the fundamental
determinants of population health through a community-based participatory process. The model was initially
designed to address the social determinants of tobacco-related health disparities through grassroots efforts
focused on policy and organizational practices and is applicable to other community issues.

The steps of CAM are as follows: 
- Step 1: Dialogue of Concern and Issues/Skill-Based Training
- Step 2: Community Diagnosis
- Step 3: Analysis
- Step 4: Plan and Implement Action/Activity
- Step 5: Sustaining Action/Activity and Evaluate Action. The role of CHWs can be easily defined within the CAM

Through the use of CHWs for capacity building, the concepts of several theories such as the Health Belief Model (HBM), Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Transtheoretical Model (TTM), and self-efficacy are all taking place at different stages when community members interact with CHWs for extended periods of time.

CHW Roles: Informing (which can include consulting), Involving, Collaborating, Empowering
