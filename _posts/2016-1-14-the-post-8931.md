I personally like a combination of [[1]](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/ReadPaper.pdf) and [[2]](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/netbib/efficientReading.pdf) when reading papers. These are summarized (mostly) in a nice infographic [here](http://www.slideshare.net/ElsevierConnect/infographic-how-to-read-scientific-papers) when reading papers.
