## Conley Chapter 5
- dyad,triad. Dyads are most intimate
- Quantiative Aspects of Groups: Georg Simmel
- Triad roles: mediator, tertius gaudens (3rd member who benefits from contact/conflict bw other 2), Divide et impera (intentionally drives wedge)
- larger than a triad? Small groups, parties, large groups.
- Small group: face to face interaction, unifocal perspective, lack of formal arrangements, certain level of equality
- party: multifocal.
- large group: formal structure that mediates structure and status differentiation (eg professor and students)
- Charles Horton Cooley: primary/secondary groups.
- Primary: limited membership. intimate f2f relationships that strongly influence attitudes/ideals (eg family/friends)
- Secondary: impersonal, instrumental relationships. Means to an end. eg labor union
- Group Conformity.
- Solomon Asch experiments (1940s): which line longer
- in group ( powerful usu. majority ) vs out group (stigmatized oft. minority). Significance by ability to define normal vs abnormal
- reference group: "group that helps us understand .. relative position in society to other group"
- social network: set of relations/dyads held tgt by individuals
- tie: content of particular relationship
- narrative: set of stories in a set of ties (eg university)
- Embeddedness: "degree to which ties are reinforced through indirect paths within a social network"
- Strength of weak ties: "notion that relatively weak ties often turn out to be quite valuable because they yield new information"
- Structural hole: "gap between network clusters, or even
two individuals, if those individuals (or clusters) have complementary resources". (possibility of a tie) 
- 6 deg of freedom (stanley milgram)
- case study: 4% of amish startups fail. social capital. everyone shops there and taboo on bankruptcy
- high school partner networks. spanning trees. "But the main rule that seemed to govern these relationships was “no cycles of four,” which means you do not date the ex of your ex’s current boyfriend or girlfriend. ". 
- Organization: "any social network that is defined by a common purpose and has a boundary between its membership and the rest of the social world"
- Organizational culture: "shared beliefs and behaviors within a social group; often used interchangeably with corporate culture"

## Ferguson: Colvin, Descent Into Madness

- social group: collection of people who have something in common and who believe what they have in common is significant
- aggregate: people @ same place @ same time (eg central park at 3pm
- categories: particular kind of person across time and space. share characteristics ( eg race )
- primary (strong ties; group exists to be group eg family) vs secondary group (shared goal, eg company)
- group dynamics: how affect each other (indiv <-> groups)
- leadership types: instrumental (achieve goals) vs expressive (minimize conflict)
- leadership styles: authoritarian (orders), democratic (consensus), laisse faire (leave to function on own)
- group conformity: 
- Milgram experiment: teacher and participant. keep administering shocks (even to deadly). Direct telling = non compliance but appeals to shared science group value = compliance. 
- Group compliance: narrowing of thought, one right answer
- reference groups: groups you compare to
- groups vs size: bigger = more stable, less intimate. Coalitions also. 
- homogenous group: better inward connections, heterogeneous group: better external connections

- they threw away previous things and adapted to environment in addition to forsaking previous beliefs about wanting to help their like kin. Also emphasizing their diverse background did not help in interviews - conformity was key here.

## Conley Chapter 4

**Socialization** 

- socialization: process by which you learn how to become a functioning member of society
- socialization: the process by which individuals internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of a given society and learn to function as members of that society.
	- limits of socializations when you're in a new social situation (e.g. diff kind of party)
    - primary unit: family

**Human Nature**
- You need to bathroom but not where you can bathroom
- "Anna" Case Study: Socialization cannot happen after such long isolation; Theories of socialization inapplicable

**Theories of Socialization**
- Self: the individual identity of a person as perceived by that same person
	- Concept of self is a social process; 
- I: one’s sense of agency, action, or powe
- Me: self as perceived as an object by the “I”; the self as one imagines others perceive one
- Cooley: Self emerges from being able to see ourselves as others do
- Mead: developed on Cooley; me is distinct
- Theory of social behavior: how others are likely to react to different situations
- Generalized other: internalized sense of the total expectations of others in a variety of settings

**Agents of Socialization**
- Generally families; not always parents -> children sometimes reverse
	- Family social class impacts how their children socialized
    - middle-class parents are more likely to engage in concerted cultivation with formal activities and reason with them over decisions to foster talents
    - Kids in less well-off families pend more time hanging out
    - Middle class kids are able to use logic and reason to support choices by mirroring parents explanations
    - Middle class kids discover confidence that comes achievements
- School
	- Teachers properly socialize you
    - All schools are not created equal
    - Prep schools link students into elite social networks
- Peers
	- Peer pressure
    - Adolescents are more open to friends advise them to parents
- Media
	- ongoing debate; e.g. sesame street: Educational programming for children who don't have day care or preschool
- Adult Socialization
	- Ways in which or socialize as an adult. For example working at a restaurant you learn your responsibilities
    - Resocialization: The process by which one's sense of social values and beliefs and norms are reengineered often deliberately through on intense social process that may take place in a total institution
    	- e.g. living in a new country; or a coed college from a single sex high school; or if you lost completely your memory
- Total Institution
	- An institution in her 20s totally immersed in that controls all the basics of day-to-day life; No barriers exist between usual spheres of daily life and all activity that occurs in same place and under same single authority; e.g. prisons, boarding schools, college, army
    - Works by placing an immense physical and mental pressure and isolating them

**Social Interaction**
- Status: Recognizable social position that a individual occupies
- Role: Duties and behaviors expected to someone who holds a particular status
- Role Strain: Incompatibility among roles corresponding to a single status
- Role conflict: tension caused by competing demands between two or more rules pertaining to different statuses
- Status set: all the statuses one holds simultaneously
- Ascribed status: status into which one is born; involuntary status
- Achieved status: status into which one enters; voluntary status
- Master status: Status within a set that stands out
- Merton's Role Theory: Acting within roles/people have roles.
	- Six types of role conflict (from Merton Sociological Ambivalence, pp. 8 - 12)
      1. Conflict within an individual's status set
      2. Conflict within the role set
      3. Conflict of the multi-cultural
      4. Cultural conflict, i.e., between cultural values
         a. This is conflict within the cultural system
      5. Conflict between aspirations and opportunity (i.e., no chance to do what you have been taught you ought to)
      6. Conflict inherent within the role itself
      
**Gender Roles**
- Gender Roles: Behavioral norms assumes to accompany status as male or female
- West/Dimmerman  argue gender status has power/significance Not captured by real theory
- Gender can constitute a master status
- Studies show people interact with babies differently depending on gender
- Larger world socializes boys and girls differently
- Socialization continues in high schools such as insults; Gender boundary policing can cause catastrophic effects

**Social Construction of Reality**
- Something is real meaningful or valuable when society tells us it is
- Childhood is the developmental stage was not always so and came after industrial times
- Teenagers became a Discrete social category after the extension of education during the 1950s
- Symbolic interactionism: Micro level theory and with shared meanings orientations and assumptions formed the basic motivations behind peoples actions
- Symbolic interactionism: How Things are socially constructed ( suggests how We interact with others have symbolic meaning meanings)
	- Three Basic Tenets
    - 1. Human beings act towards ideas concepts and values on the basis of meaning that they have for them
    - 2. Meetings are the products of social interactions in human society
    - 3. Meanings are modified and filtered through an interpretive process that each individual uses in dealing with outward signs
    - Useful for Understanding cultural differences and styles of social interaction
  
**Dramaturgical Theory**
- Erving Goffman: Language of theater as a paradigm to formally describe the ways in which we interact to maintain social order
- Dramaturgical Theory: View of social life as a theatrical performance in which we are all actors on metaphorical stages with roles scripts costumes and sets
- Morals are depression management
- Role as a student;  professor handed out syllabus (prop) and give an outline of the class ( script) and lecture (performance). Talking about Batman would deviate from the script
- Important distinction between front stage and backstage
- Face: The esteem in which an individual is held by others
- Opening the start of an encounter; Closing: The end of any interaction; Civic inattention: Refraining from directly interacting with someone till an opening; Given gestures can signal a closing; Giving off gestures can unconsciously signal true feelings.
- In Breaches people  work hard to repair the mistake so everyone can move forward 
- Goal of social interaction is to Make a good impressionAnd works to ensure that others believe they're also making a good impression


**Ethnomethodology**
- Harold Garfinkel (1950/60)
- Literally "the methods of the people"; approach to studying human interaction focusing on the ways we make sense of our World, Convey this understanding to others and produce a shared social order
- Famous for breaching experiments: what happens when breaching social norms.

**New Technologies: What How's the Internet Done to interaction?**
- new social situations without established social norms
- eg online chat rooms: new lexicon but difficult to deploy closing brackets
- Redefining the term stealing

**Conclusion**
- nature versus nurture, generally sociologists: nurture
- Socialization helps understand how babies become people who attend college

## Ferguson: Haunani-Kay Trask, Lovely Hula Hands
"Lovely Hula Hands: Corporate Tourism and the Prostitution of Hawaiian Culture"

- Haiwaiians have less rights than American Indians
- American's don't know where Hawaii is but feel entitled to use it and the destruction of Hawaiian land is by MNCs
- Prostitution is used as an analytic category/metaphor to convey the degradation of Hawaiian culture and people under tourism

Author will examine: 1) homeland incl lands,fisheries,sea,skies 2) language and dance 3) familial relationships 4) women

- In Hawaii there is a younger sibling/elder sibling + chief<-> villagers symbiosism.
- Aloha is a cultural feeling and practice that works b/w the people and their land
- Hawaiian language was banned by Americans and only now is making a resurgency (and dance).
- Hawaiian values are different than those of the traditional west and that annoys many visitors (e.g. shared property and children and open relationships).
- In contrast the American relationship of people to land is exploitative
- Tourism is the only job propoganda is spread;
- "Our language, dance, young poeple and customs of eating are used to ensnare tourists ... for $39.95".
- Hawaiians are required to be complicit or face unemployment and are frequently forced to leave Hawaii as a result.

## Chapter 3 Conley Reading

3 Culture and Media
- Does culture or media come first?
- Culture = Human – Nature, Culture = (Superior) Man – (Inferior) Man, Culture = Man – Machine
	- Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) redefined culture as the pursuit of perfection and broad knowledge of the world in contrast to narrow self-centeredness and material gain.
