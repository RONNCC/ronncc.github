## Conley Chapter 4

**Socialization** 

- socialization: process by which you learn how to become a functioning member of society
- socialization: the process by which individuals internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of a given society and learn to function as members of that society.
	- limits of socializations when you're in a new social situation (e.g. diff kind of party)
    - primary unit: family

**Human Nature**
- You need to bathroom but not where you can bathroom
- "Anna" Case Study: Socialization cannot happen after such long isolation; Theories of socialization inapplicable

**Theories of Socialization**
- Self: the individual identity of a person as perceived by that same person
	- Concept of self is a social process; 
- I: one’s sense of agency, action, or powe
- Me: self as perceived as an object by the “I”; the self as one imagines others perceive one
- Cooley: Self emerges from being able to see ourselves as others do
- Mead: developed on Cooley; me is distinct
- Theory of social behavior: how others are likely to react to different situations
- Generalized other: internalized sense of the total expectations of others in a variety of settings

**Agents of Socialization**
- Generally families; not always parents -> children sometimes reverse
	- Family social class impacts how their children socialized
    - middle-class parents are more likely to engage in concerted cultivation with formal activities and reason with them over decisions to foster talents
    - Kids in less well-off families pend more time hanging out
    - Middle class kids are able to use logic and reason to support choices by mirroring parents explanations
    - Middle class kids discover confidence that comes achievements
- School
	- Teachers properly socialize you
    - All schools are not created equal
    - Prep schools link students into elite social networks
- Peers
	- Peer pressure
    - Adolescents are more open to friends advise them to parents
- Media
	- ongoing debate; e.g. sesame street: Educational programming for children who don't have day care or preschool
- Adult Socialization
	- Ways in which or socialize as an adult. For example working at a restaurant you learn your responsibilities
    - Resocialization: The process by which one's sense of social values and beliefs and norms are reengineered often deliberately through on intense social process that may take place in a total institution
    	- e.g. living in a new country; or a coed college from a single sex high school; or if you lost completely your memory
- Total Institution
	- An institution in her 20s totally immersed in that controls all the basics of day-to-day life; No barriers exist between usual spheres of daily life and all activity that occurs in same place and under same single authority; e.g. prisons, boarding schools, college, army
    - Works by placing an immense physical and mental pressure and isolating them

**Social Interaction**

## Ferguson: Haunani-Kay Trask, Lovely Hula Hands
"Lovely Hula Hands: Corporate Tourism and the Prostitution of Hawaiian Culture"

- Haiwaiians have less rights than American Indians
- American's don't know where Hawaii is but feel entitled to use it and the destruction of Hawaiian land is by MNCs
- Prostitution is used as an analytic category/metaphor to convey the degradation of Hawaiian culture and people under tourism

Author will examine: 1) homeland incl lands,fisheries,sea,skies 2) language and dance 3) familial relationships 4) women

- In Hawaii there is a younger sibling/elder sibling + chief<-> villagers symbiosism.
- Aloha is a cultural feeling and practice that works b/w the people and their land
- Hawaiian language was banned by Americans and only now is making a resurgency (and dance).
- Hawaiian values are different than those of the traditional west and that annoys many visitors (e.g. shared property and children and open relationships).
- In contrast the American relationship of people to land is exploitative
- Tourism is the only job propoganda is spread;
- "Our language, dance, young poeple and customs of eating are used to ensnare tourists ... for $39.95".
- Hawaiians are required to be complicit or face unemployment and are frequently forced to leave Hawaii as a result.

## Chapter 3 Conley Reading

3 Culture and Media
- Does culture or media come first?
- Culture = Human – Nature, Culture = (Superior) Man – (Inferior) Man, Culture = Man – Machine
	- Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) redefined culture as the pursuit of perfection and broad knowledge of the world in contrast to narrow self-centeredness and material gain.
