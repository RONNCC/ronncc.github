## Perspectives on pervasive health from some of the field's leading researchers
Dey et al (2011)

*Question Being Answered*:  What is pervasive health and what's happening in it?

*One sentence answer*:  Collated opinions  - no summary

*"Low Level" Notes*:  

**What is Pervasive Health?**
- Application of pervasive computing tech for healthcare/health
- Making healthcare available everywhere/everytime
- Using ubicomp tech to increase medical knowledge / contribute to healthcare delivery
- Convergence of personal devices, sensing, embedded computing to advance healthcare quality

**Example Projects:**
- Mining reality to collect "honest" signals
- Social signals can assess behavior diseases (e.g. obesity)
- Continuous sedentary activity type detection
- Mobile phone weight lost intervention tool using JIT feedback and persuasive theories
- FitBaby, connecting parents with clinicians and documentation of daily premature-infant living
- Detection of pressure ulcers

They conclude that the area is is a burgeoning research area and they "expect ... [smartphones] .. will be a dominant research and consumer platform for pervasive health" and mention some challenges, e.g. low power, sophisticated sensing, balancing privacy concerns, and treating "in clinically valid ways".

## Can Mobile Health Tech Transform Health Care?

Steinhubl et al (2013) [[PubMed]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24158428)

*Question Being Answered*:  Can Mobile Health Tech Transform Healthcare?

*One sentence answer*: The potential exists but there are obstacles  


*"Low Level" Notes*:  
- 3 powerful drivers:
    1. Unsustainability of current healthcare spending
    2. Rapid growth of wireless connectivity (>3.2b mobile users)
    3. Need for personalized medicine
- Obstacles:
    1. Current health care system complexities & reimbursement incentives
    2. Low quality apps (potentially harmful)
- Possible Use cases now:
    - *self* - Diagnosing acute symptoms (34% of visits are b/c of acute symptoms. e.g. Viral respiratory tract infections)
    - Recording biometric info
    - Better control chronic issues ( > 50% of US has >= 1 chronic condition - 90% of spending) 
        - Hypertension (1/3 adults, 40m office visits, $93b costs): possible improvements: Home monitoring & Blood Pressure Cuffs. 

All of these can reduce # of doctor visits. Move general doctor time to patients that need it rather than general algorithmic visits. 

*Questions I have*:   
- Self diagnosing is generally a contentious point!
- Otitis Media? : Middle ear inflammatory disease family

*Particularly Interesting Phrases/Points*:
