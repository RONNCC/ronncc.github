## Ferguson: Haunani-Kay Trask, Lovely Hula Hands
"Lovely Hula Hands: Corporate Tourism and the Prostitution of Hawaiian Culture"

- Haiwaiians have less rights than American Indians
- American's don't know where Hawaii is but feel entitled to use it and the destruction of Hawaiian land is by MNCs
- Prostitution is used as an analytic category/metaphor to convey the degradation of Hawaiian culture and people under tourism

Author will examine: 1) homeland incl lands,fisheries,sea,skies 2) language and dance 3) familial relationships 4) women

- In Hawaii there is a younger sibling/elder sibling + chief<-> villagers symbiosism.
- Aloha is a cultural feeling and practice that works b/w the people and their land
- Hawaiian language was banned by Americans and only now is making a resurgency (and dance).
- Hawaiian values are different than those of the traditional west and that annoys many visitors (e.g. shared property and children and open relationships).
- In contrast the American relationship of people to land is exploitative
- Tourism is the only job propoganda is spread;
- "Our language, dance, young poeple and customs of eating are used to ensnare tourists ... for $39.95".
- Hawaiians are required to be complicit or face unemployment and are frequently forced to leave Hawaii as a result.
