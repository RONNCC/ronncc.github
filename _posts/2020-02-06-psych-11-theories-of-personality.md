# Chapter 1
-  word “personality” originated from the Latin persona
- **personality**: a pattern of relatively permanent traits and unique characteristics that give both consistency and individuality to a person’s behavior
- **Traits**: contribute to individual differences in behavior, consistency of behavior over time, and stability of behavior across situations
- **Characteristics**: unique qualities of an individual that include such attributes as temperament, physique, and intelligence
- **taxonomy** : a classification of things according to their natural relationships

Theoretical Perspectives on Personality:
- Psychodynamic Theories
	- importance of early childhood experience and on relationships with parents as guiding forces that shape personality development
    -  traditionally used dream inter- pretation to uncover the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and impulses as a main form of treatment of neurosis and mental illness.
    - After Freud, these theorists moved away from the importance of sexuality and more toward social and cultural forces.
- Humanistic-Existential Theories
	- people strive toward meaning, growth, well-being, happi- ness, and psychological health
    - Existential theorists assume that not only are we driven by a search for meaning, but also that negative experiences such as failure, awareness of death, death of a loved one, and anxiety, are part of the human condition and can foster psychological growth
- Dispositional Theories
	- unique and long-term tendencies to behave in particular ways are the essence of our personality
    - five main trait dimensions in human personality
- Biological-Evolutionary Theories
	- Behavior, thought, feelings, and personality are influenced by differences in basic genetic, epigenetic, and neurological systems between individuals. 
- Learning-(Social) Cognitive Theories
	- All behaviors are learned through association and/or its consequences (whether it is reinforced or punished). To shape desired behavior we have to understand and then establish the conditions that bring about those particular behaviors.
